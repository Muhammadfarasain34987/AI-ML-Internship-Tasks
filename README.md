# AI-ML-Internship-Tasks
This repository contains the three projects I completed during my AI/ML internship. Each project was focused on learning basic machine learning steps from exploring data to training models and checking accuracy.

1. Task Objective
The main goal of these tasks was to understand how to load datasets explore them visualize important patterns, train machine learning models and evaluate their performance in a simple and clear way.

2. Datasets Used

House Price Prediction: A housing dataset with features like rooms, area, and location to predict house prices.

Heart Disease Prediction: A heart disease dataset containing health-related features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure etc.

Exploring & Visualizing a Simple Dataset: The Iris dataset used for basic data analysis and visualization practice.

3. Models Applied

In the projects I used several machine learning models including:

Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting for predicting house prices

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for heart disease prediction

Basic visualizations like histograms, heatmaps, and pair plots in the Iris task.

4. Key Results and Findings

The House Price Prediction model gave a good understanding of regression and how features affect price.

The Heart Disease Prediction models showed that Logistic Regression and Decision Tree gave good accuracy on test data.

The Iris visualization task helped build confidence in exploring datasets, checking distributions and understanding correlations.
